    "The starter code below produces histograms for the `loudness` feature using pandas plotting. The histograms show the distribution of the feature values in the training set, separated for positive (target=1, i.e., user liked the song) and negative (target=0, i.e., user disliked the song) examples. There are two different histograms, one for target = 0 and one for target = 1, and they are overlaid on top of each other. The histogram shows that extremely quiet songs tend to be disliked (more blue bars than orange on the left) and very loud songs also tend to be disliked (more blue than orange on the far right).\n",

    "**Effect on training accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "_As `max_depth` increases, the training accuracy increases monotinically. For shallow trees(e.g depth=1), the training accuracy is relatively low(0.65), indicating that the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. As the depth increases, the tree can make splits and fit the training data more closely. By depth 15 and above, the training accuracy is nearly perfect(), showing that the model is effectiveky memorizing the training data._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on cross-validation (test) accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "_The cv accuracy initially improves as depth increases, rising from about 0.65 at depth 1 to a peak of approximately 0.71 at depth 5. This indicates that increasing model complexity initially helps the model generalize better. However, beyond this point, cv accuracy begins to decline as depth continues to increase. For large depths(e.g 15-23), the test accuracy drops to around 0.66, despite near-perfect training accuracy_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamental tradeoff(bias-variance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern illustrates bias-variance tradeoff:\n",
    "- Low max_depth(underfitting/high bias) - the model is too simple, resulting in low training and test accuracy\n",
    "- Moderate max_depth(best tradeoff) - Around depth 5,  the model balances bias and variance, achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy\n",
    "- High max_depth (overfitting / high variance) - The model fits the training data extremely well but generalizes poorly, as seen by decreasing cv(test) accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Increasing `max_depth` decreases bias but increases variance. CV helps identify the optimal depth where test performance is maximized, which in this case occurs at a moderate depth rather than the deepest tree. This demonstrates why hyperparameter tuning is essential and why higher training accuracy does not necessarily imply better model_ "

    "Are \"key,\" \"mode,\" and \"time_signature\" actually numeric?\n",
    "\n",
    "While these features are stored as numeric types in the dataset, they are categorical in nature. For example, \"key\" represents musical keys (0–11), \"mode\" indicates major/minor (0 or 1), and \"time_signature\" represents common time signatures (3, 4, 5, etc.). Treating them as continuous numeric features can mislead some models, but for decision trees, this is generally not a problem because trees can split on discrete values effectively."

    "Does the scale difference between features matter for DecisionTreeClassifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, scale differences do not matter for decision trees. Unlike models that rely on distances (e.g., k-NN, SVM) or gradient-based optimization (e.g., linear/logistic regression), decision trees only consider thresholds for splitting features. So a feature like duration_ms (large numeric values) can be used directly alongside features like acousticness (0–1) without scaling."

    "How would you encode the \"artist\" feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since “artist” is a categorical text feature, you could encode it using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies or OneHotEncoder) if the number of unique artists is manageable. Alternatively, for a large number of artists, target encoding (replacing each artist with the mean target value) or embedding representations may be more efficient, especially to avoid very high-dimensional feature matrices."
